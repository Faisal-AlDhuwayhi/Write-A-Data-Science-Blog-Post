## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.x. However, the libraries used are:
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [plotly](https://plotly.com/)

You will need to download [Stackoverflowâ€™s 2017 Annual Developer Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017). You can find the data for other years to download [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. What are the most common programming languages in the industry in 2017?
2. How programming languages are related to salary and job satisfaction?
3. What are the most common platforms in the industry in 2017?

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@alduohy11/interesting-facts-about-programming-in-2017-4a42269c20ae).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
